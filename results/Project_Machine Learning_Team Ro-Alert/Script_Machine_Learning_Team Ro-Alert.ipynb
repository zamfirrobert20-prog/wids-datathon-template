All evaluated models achieve an overall accuracy of approximately 92.7–92.8%, confirming that alert delays can be reliably predicted using the selected operational features. This indicates that the problem formulation is appropriate and that the chosen variables capture meaningful signals related to alert delays.\n","\n","Among the evaluated models, Random Forest and XGBoost exhibit the strongest overall performance, with very similar results across all metrics. Both models achieve high precision (≈ 0.93) and exceptionally high recall (above 99%) for delayed alerts, indicating that nearly all truly delayed cases are correctly identified. This property is essential in an alerting context, where failing to detect delayed alerts represents the most costly type of error. In terms of discrimination power, Random Forest attains the highest ROC AUC (≈ 0.847), closely followed by XGBoost (≈ 0.846), while the Decision Tree records a lower value (≈ 0.836). Although the numerical differences are modest, they are consistent across ROC curves and evaluation metrics, highlighting the advantage of ensemble-based methods over a single-tree model.\n","\n","**Clustering-Based Risk Profiling**\n","\n","The unsupervised clustering analysis identifies three statistically distinct wildfire risk profiles, each characterized by clearly different numerical patterns. One cluster corresponds to very large-scale incidents with near-total containment (≈ 99%) but the longest alert delays (over 16,000 minutes) and the highest delayed alert rate (above 98%), highlighting the operational complexity associated with mega-fires. A second cluster also exhibits high containment (≈ 99.1%) but significantly smaller average fire size (≈ 29,700 acres) and shorter alert delays (≈ 8,856 minutes), indicating faster alert handling when incident scale is reduced. The third cluster is defined by very low containment (≈ 23.7%), moderate fire size (≈ 8,468 acres), and long alert delays (over 13,300 minutes), demonstrating that low containment alone can drive substantial alert delays, independently of fire scale.\n","\n","**Key Findings and Visual Insights**\n","\n","Visualizations support and reinforce these findings. Histograms reveal highly skewed distributions for acreage and alert lag, justifying normalization prior to clustering. The elbow method clearly indicates three clusters as the optimal choice, balancing interpretability and explanatory power. Scatter plots in logarithmic scale show clear separation between routine, mega-fire, and active-risk profiles, while confusion matrices and ROC curves illustrate the strong predictive capability of the supervised models, particularly the ensemble approaches. Spatial visualizations further contextualize alert delays geographically, linking model outputs to real-world locations.\n","\n","**Model Selection and Operational Implications**\n","\n","Based on quantitative performance metrics and visual diagnostics, an ensemble-based model is selected for the alerting framework, with Random Forest and XGBoost both representing suitable choices due to their strong discrimination power and extremely high recall for delayed alerts. When combined with predefined probability thresholds, their outputs can be translated into actionable alert levels that distinguish low-risk situations from those requiring early escalation. The alignment between clustering-derived risk profiles and supervised predictions further validates the framework, as higher delay probabilities are consistently assigned to incidents characterized by extreme acreage or low containment.\n","\n","**Limitations and Ethical Considerations**\n","\n","Several limitations should be acknowledged. The analysis relies on historical incident data and does not incorporate real-time sensor inputs or physical fire-spread modeling. Population exposure and individual-level vulnerability are not directly modeled, and the system is designed to support decision-making rather than automate evacuation orders. From an ethical perspective, the framework prioritizes transparency and interpretability, ensuring that alert decisions can be audited and explained, while minimizing the risk of systematically missing high-risk delayed alerts."],"metadata":{"id":"b8j55x3-5JZ9"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Team Contributions\n","\n","| Name         | Contributions                                |\n","|--------------|----------------------------------------------|\n","| Țilică Mihnea David       | EDA, Model Validation          |\n","| Radu Alexandru Claudiu           | \tEDA, Model Testing      |\n","| Zamfir Robert Dan     | Clustering, Model Training            |\n","| Sasu Sabrina          |Clustering, Model Validation         |\n","| Săndulescu Crina     | Model Testing, Data Cleaning            |\n","| Sandu Bianca Antonia  | Model Training, Data Cleaning       |"],"metadata":{"id":"m1f1MhXsY6RW"}}],"metadata":{"colab":{"provenance":[{"file_id":"https://github.com/sasusabrina22/wids-datathon-template/blob/main/notebook.ipynb","timestamp":1766513202458}]},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"name":"python","version":"3.8"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
